# fullstack-todosApp
# Here, we've created our backend using mongoose and express. We've also created our frontend using react and tailwindcss.
# This simple full-stack project has helped me learn about a lot of things like, mongoose connection from the atlas instead of from the locally downloaded and installed thing.
